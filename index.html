                            To use this app, simply input a search and hit enter! The restaurant list appears as a list
                            of
                            cards on the left side of the screen, and as markers on the map.</p>

                        <p> This web application was designed to help my ESL students get practice recognizing the
                            differences
                            between distinct phonemes in English that are tricky for non-native speakers to hear.
                            Students
                            can select a group of sounds they want to practice, and then several audio quizzes will
                            show
                            how well they can distinguish those sounds.

                        <h2>Canvas Watchfaces</h2>
                        <p> I created this node module to be able to show off some of my watch face designs on my
                            personal
                            website. The problem: all my Android Watch watch faces were created via Watchmaker Pro
                            and are
                            saved in a format unreadable by browsers. The solution: I created a node module that
                            takes .watch
                            files, parses them, and outputs a javascript file that draws a nearly perfect facsimile
                            as an
                            HTML Canvas element.
